## Envision Bank Smart Spending & Savings Dashboard

This folder contains designs I created for Envision Bank's smart spending and savings dashboard and marine UI as part of the Capgemini RISE program. Envision Bank was looking to improve their digital offerings to help customers better manage their money and reach their financial goals.

### Dashboard
The dashboard design provides a consolidated view of key account information, security tasks, connected devices, recent transactions and an overall account health score.

These designs aim to provide simple yet powerful tools to help Envision Bank's customers visualize their financial picture and make smart money moves. By enabling customers to easily see their full financial situation and access helpful savings and spending insights, Envision Bank can deliver more value, boost engagement and customer loyalty, and regain market share in an increasingly competitive banking landscape.
