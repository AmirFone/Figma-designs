## Pomodoro Time Management App

This folder contains designs I created for a Pomodoro time management app to help people better utilize their time and be more productive. The app incorporates the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

### Home Screen
The home screen provides a simple and intuitive interface for the user to start a Pomodoro session. It displays the app name and a prominent "START" button.

### Pomodoro Session
During a Pomodoro session, the app displays a countdown timer set to 25 minutes. The user can see the remaining time in the session at a glance.

### Short Break
After completing a Pomodoro session, the app automatically switches to a short break of 5 minutes. This allows the user to rest and recharge before starting another focused work session.

### Long Break
After completing four Pomodoro sessions, the app suggests a longer break of 15-30 minutes. This longer break helps the user to fully relax and return to work with renewed energy and focus.

### Focus Time
The app also includes a "Focus Time" feature, which allows the user to set a custom focus session duration. This flexibility enables users to adapt the Pomodoro Technique to their specific needs and preferences.

By providing a simple and effective tool for implementing the Pomodoro Technique, this app aims to help users maintain focus, avoid burnout, and ultimately improve their productivity and time management skills. The clean and intuitive design ensures that users can easily incorporate this powerful technique into their daily routines.
